# Introduction #

Trainings to be oriented towards the roles on the various groups involved with the system:

  * Orientation (awareness training) to a broad group of staff and other stakeholders in the LGU.
  * Hands-on operation (testing the functionality of the system) for the
  * Data-entry system
  * Reporting
  * Systems operations
  * eRPTS operations management

Issues encountered in the eBPLS trainings:
  * wrong people sent on training
  * long delay between training and implementation
  * need for retraining
  * building Linux expertise
  * oversight/management training lacking

# Details #

Primarily important is end user trainings - supervisor and management training should not be ignored, but without quality end user training there can be no successes.  The eRPTS will likely involve more departments (for most municipalities) than did eBPLS.  For most, at least the ICT Unit and the Accessor and Treasury departments will be involved at the end user level, and at least one person from each of these groups, people with "their hands on the keyboard," will need to attend the formal, detailed, end user training.

Supervisor and managers may also need training but the level, intensity and focus they require is very different from the end users training.  Where end users might need 5 days training to cover all system operational details, supervisors and managers would only need a 1 or 2 day overview of the system.  The supervisors and managers overview training would make them aware of the needs for operation of the eRPTS system, but they do not need the step-by-step, key-by-key details that the "hands-on" users require.  Installation, maintenance, upgrade issues as ICT Unit processes;  Operation and end user involvement as work flow processes;  etc.  but no details on how it is done since they will not be part of the day-to-day “hands on the keyboard” operation of the system.

ICT users will need full, "end-to-end" training - installation, operation, end user, maintenance and upgrade training.  Accessor and Treasurer users will need detailed operational training for their day-to-day activities, BUT they will also benefit from getting exposure and therefore appreciation for each other’s roles in the system processes and also appreciation for the ICT Unit’s role.  It is likely not practical and not desirable to deliver different course materials for each of these 3 groups and it would be beneficial if one person from each group was trained at the same time, together as a "working unit".
